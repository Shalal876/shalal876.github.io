            <h2><u>Summary of "Twelve Pillars" by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener</u></h2>
            <p>
                In these chapters, Michael and Charlie, his mentor, meet at a diner and talk about the 
                value of goal setting. Michael learns important life lessons from Charlie, who has been 
                employed at the Twelve Pillars estate since its founding. They discuss the importance of 
                having objectives to succeed and the necessity of putting work into relationships, 
                comparing it to caring for a garden.
            </p>

            <p>
                Charlie highlights that the main motivation for establishing a goal is your ability to 
                achieve it. He suggests that Michael put his objectives in writing since doing so makes 
                them more tangible and forces the mind to work toward reaching them. He adds that 
                goals offer a clear route to accomplishment and aid in reorienting oneself. Charlie 
                advises Michael to establish short-, mid-, and long-term objectives as well as "micro-
                goals," which will help him divide the process of realizing his desires into smaller, more 
                doable steps.

            <h2><u>Reflection and Application</u></h2>
            <p>
                As a student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in <a href="https://www.utech.edu.jm/academics/colleges-faculties/fenc/scit/courses-of-study/bsc-in-computer-networking-and-security" target="_blank"> Bachelor of Science in Computer Networking and Security</a>, 
                these lessons can be incredibly valuable. 
            </p></br>

            <p><u>Set Clear Goals</u></p></br>

            <p>
                Put clear study goals in writing. My current skill set includes network configuration, 
                virtualization, and Python and SQL coding. I should make goals to become proficient in 
                these newly learned abilities, such as virtualization strategies, SQL and Python coding, 
                and network security protocols. Divide these into more manageable goals, such as 
                doing a specific number of coding assignments per week or reading a chapter from a 
                relevant textbook every day. Clearly state my professional goals. Decide if I want to work 
                as a cybersecurity analyst, or network security specialist, or launch my own IT 
                consulting company. establishing specific, time-bound objectives for developing a 
                professional network, earning experience, and earning credentials.

            </p></br></br>

            <p><u>Continuous Improvement</u></p></br>

            <p>
                Make a constant effort to advance my abilities, just as Michael invested more time in his 
                relationship. Set aside time per week to work on virtualization projects, network 
                configuration, and coding practice. To improve my learning, I take part in study groups, 
                go to workshops, and use internet resources. 
                Improve my soft skills, such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. These 
                are essential to my performance in the field of computer networking and security, as I 
                frequently collaborate with clients and colleagues to find solutions to challenging 
                issues.

            </p></br>

            <p><u>Adaptability and Persistence</u></p></br>

            <p>
                Realizing that it could take some time and work to reach my goals. Charlie once said, 
                "You cannot change your destination overnight, but you can change your direction 
                overnight." I should attempt to keep that in mind whenever I encounter obstacles. 
                Maintain my flexibility and perseverance in pursuing my objectives, even if it appears 
                like a long road.
